<li>Look for a button towards the top of the page with a "+" icon and a little arrow pointing down.  Click that and a dropdown will appear.  Click the option "new repository".</li>
<li>In the field "repository name" and write the name of your website all in one word.</li>
<li>There's another option to choose between making your repository "public" or "private".  "public" means that the code you write will be visible to people looking at your github profile.  If you want to keep your code secret, select "private".</li>
<li>Don't worry about the other options.</li>
<li>click "create repository"</li>
<li>You'll then be taken to your github home page.  But now you have your new repository.  Click on your repository link to be taken to its page.</li>
<li>Underneath the large name of your repository, you'll see a row of things you can click: a dropdown with the word "main", some icons, a search back with the placeholder text "go to file" and a button with a "+" symbol.  Click that button and select the option "create new file".</li>
<li>Add the title of your website, click to save, and name your file "index.html"</li>

<li>click the button labeled "sign up with GitHub"</li>
<li>click the button labeled "authorize netlify"</li>
<li>follow those steps.</li>
<li>If that doesn't work for any reason, go back to sign up and click the bottom link labeled "sign up with email" and follow those steps</li>
<li>Once you're logged into Netlify, look for the text "Sites".  Below that click the button "Import from Git"</li>
<li>click "deply with GitHub"</li>
<li>When you see the page that says "Install Netlify" at the top, scroll down and click "install".</li>
<li>You'll now see the name of your Github repository.  click that.</li>
<li>Now's it time for you to make the domain of your website.  It will end in "netlify.app".  You can try to name it the same name as your repository but click the button "check availability" to see if anyone has already taken it.  If they have, that's ok.  You can just add rename your website URL to something else until you find something that's available.</li>
<li>click the button to create your website</li>
<li>now wait for netlify to say that your website is published.</li>
<li>click the URL for your new website and share it with a friend!</li>
