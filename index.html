<h1>Make a Website, Fast!</h1>

<ol>
<li>
Make an account on <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>.  Get the free account!
</li>
<li>Look for a button towards the top of the page with a "+" icon and a little arrow pointing down.  Click that and a dropdown will appear.  Click the option "new repository".</li>
<li>In the field "repository name" and write the name of your website all in one word.</li>
<li>There's another option to choose between making your repository "public" or "private".  "public" means that the code you write will be visible to people looking at your github profile.  If you want to keep your code secret, select "private".</li>
<li>Don't worry about the other options.</li>
<li>click "create repository"</li>
<li>You'll then be taken to your github home page.  But now you have your new repository.  Click on your repository link to be taken to its page.</li>
<li>Underneath the large name of your repository, you'll see a row of things you can click: a dropdown with the word "main", some icons, a search back with the placeholder text "go to file" and a button with a "+" symbol.  Click that button and select the option "create new file".</li>
<li>Add the title of your website, click to save, and name your file "index.html"</li>
<li>Go to the signup page on netlify.com https://app.netlify.com/signup</li>
<li>click the button labeled "sign up with GitHub"</li>
<li>click the button labeled "authorize netlify"</li>
<li>follow those steps.</li>
<li>If that doesn't work for any reason, go back to sign up and click the bottom link labeled "sign up with email" and follow those steps</li>
</ol>
